📌 Project Description

Automated Image Scraper with Scrolling is a Python-based web scraping project that uses Selenium to extract images and their associated metadata from Pixabay

This project is useful for:

Automating image collection for datasets

The extracted data can be saved in both Excel (.xlsx) and JSON (.json) formats for easy use and further processing.
